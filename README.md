All user data will be stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/). The front end was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

All user data can be viewed under the AllData tab in the navigation bar.

## Technology Used

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[Express](http://expressjs.com/)
[React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Features
