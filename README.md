## Description

In this project, I've created a MERN Banking Application. Users can create accounts, make deposits, withdrawls, and check balances.

The front end was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). All user data will be created and stored in a database within the backend of the application with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The frontend and backend are connected via a server wtih [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

All user data can be viewed under the AllData tab in the navigation bar.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## Technology Used

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[Express](http://expressjs.com/)
[React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

## Features

Current features include the ability to create account, make deposits, withdrawals, and check balance.

Future feature improvements will include adding roles for different users, such as bank employee vs customer with Firebase authentication and authorization. Additional security will be added that only the logged in user can see their own account information.
