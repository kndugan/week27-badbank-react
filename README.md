# Week 27 BadBank with React

## Description

In this project, I've created a MERN Banking Application. Users can create accounts, make deposits, withdrawls, and check balances. All user data will be stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/). The front end was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). All user data can be viewed under the AllData tab in the navigation bar. 

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.


## Installation Guidelines

In the project directory,

#### 1. Install Dependencies

To install all of the app dependencies, including Node JS, MongoDB, Express, CORS, and LowDB, run:

### `npm install`

#### 2. Run the application 

In terminal, run the following command to launch the server and application: 

### `node index.js`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.


## Technology Used

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[Express](http://expressjs.com/)
[React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

## Features

Current features include the ability to create account, make deposits, withdrawals, and check balance.

Future feature improvements will include adding roles for different users, such as bank employee vs customer with Firebase authentication and authorization. Additional security will be added that only the logged in user can see their own account information.
